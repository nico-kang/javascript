How to merge objectsï¼Ÿ

You can use 'Object.assign()' or the spread operator '...' to merge JavaScript objects. Below are two methods for merging objects:

1.Merge objects using 'Object.assign()'
2.Merge object Using the spread operator '...'.

Note that if the merged objects contain properties with the same name, the value of the later property will overwrite the value of the earlier property.



How to determine if an object is empty

You can determine whether an object is empty using the following two methods:

1.Use the Object.keys() method to get a list of the object's properties, and then check if the length of the list is 0.

2.Use a for...in loop to traverse the object. If any property exists, then the object is not empty.

The effect of both methods is the same, allowing you to choose based on the specific situation.
